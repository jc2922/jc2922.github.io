This is a Bomberman game written with the help of the Three.js library. There are three AIs (red) and one human player (blue). Use the arrow keys to navigate
through the maze and spacebar for placing a bomb. 

The maze is generated randomly using the Prim's algorithm with some modifications. The AIs use the breadth-first search algorithm to
navigate through the maze and it uses a function called checkL() to find a safe spot to move to after it places a bomb or when it 
encounters a bomb in its proximity.
